# BLauncher
BLauncher is an alternative launcher of the famous Minecraft game.

# Using
**Please replace the lang.py file with the lang_en.py file, keeping the name, to change the language to English.**

**To use the launcher you need access to the java command from the console!**
1. Install the dependency `pip install minecraft-launcher-lib`.
2. Run the file `main.py`.
3. If you have a Minecraft license, then click on `Log in through Mojang`, where enter your username and password for your account. I wonâ€™t get access to them; the login function can be found in `main.py` (line 88).
Fields `Nick`,` UUID`, `Token` will be filled automatically. If there is no license, then in the field `Nick` enter the desired name in the game, and fill in 2 other fields with random characters.
4. Select a game version and click on `Launch`. The game client will load and start.

If you run the launcher through an EXE file, then start with 3 points.
